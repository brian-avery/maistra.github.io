Before you Begin
----------------

. Install Maistra by following the instructions here link:../install[here].
. Deploy Bookinfo application by following these link:../bookinfo[instructions].


Generate Traces
---------------

Once Bookinfo application has been deployed, generate traces by accessing http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage a few times.


Analyze Tracing Data using Jaeger
---------------------------------

Maistra installer should have created a route to access Jaeger dashboard. Query openshift for details of the route:

```
  $ oc get routes jaeger-query -n istio-system
  NAME           HOST/PORT                                    PATH      SERVICES       PORT           TERMINATION   WILDCARD
  jaeger-query   jaeger-query-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io             jaeger-query   jaeger-query   edge          None

```

Point your browser to https://jaeger-query-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io, select "productpage" from the "Service" drop-down list, and click "Find Traces". You should see a list of available traces similar to one below:

Click on one of the traces in the list to open a detailed view of that trace:

The trace above consists of a few nested spans, each corresponding to a Bookinfo service call, all performed in response to a /productpage request. Overall processing time was 2.62s, with "details" service taking 3.56ms, "reviews" service taking 2.6s, and "ratings" service -- 5.32ms. Each of the calls to remote services is represented by a client-side and server-side spans. For example, "details" client-side span is labeled `productpage details.myproject.svc.cluster.local:9080`. The span nested undeneath it labeled `details details.myproject.svc.cluster.local:9080` corresponds to the server-side processing of the request.

The trace also shows calls to "istio-policy" which reflect authorization checks made by istio.

Cleanup
-------

Follow link:../bookinfo/#cleanup[Bookinfo cleanup instructions] to remove the application.
