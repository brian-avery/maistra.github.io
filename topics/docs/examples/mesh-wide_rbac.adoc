Using RBAC policies requires mTLS strict mode. For information about how to enable it, see link:../mesh-wide_mtls/[Enabling Mesh-wide Strict mTLS].

== Introduction

Istio supports policies that define Role-based Access Control rules (RBAC) to specify which services can communicate within the mesh. Role-based means that you first create a role that defines a set of actions that can legally be performed on a set of resources, and then map the defined role to a set of services. The ServiceRole can define e.g. legal HTTP verbs and endpoints for HTTP services, or access to certain ports for TCP services. The resources resemble the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Kubernetes RBAC objects]. If you are familiar with those, you should be able to get started quickly with using Maistra's RBAC capabilities.

The following example enables RBAC policy enforcement in your Maistra mesh. Note that by default, Istio's RBAC functionality _denies all requests that are not explicitly permitted_. Without any further action, this makes communication between your services impossible.

=== Creating the ServiceMeshRbacConfig

Creating the following resource in your control plane's project enables RBAC policy enforcement in your mesh:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshRbacConfig
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: <CONTROL_PLANE_NS>
spec:
  mode: 'ON'

{{% notice tip %}}
This resource does not exist in upstream Istio, it has been added to Maistra. It replaces the upstream ClusterRbacConfig, which is cluster-scoped. For more information, see the link:../../comparison-with-istio/#cluster_scoped_resources[comparison of Maistra and upstream Istio].
