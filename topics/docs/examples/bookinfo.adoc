== Bookinfo application

The following steps describe the deployment of the Bookinfo application on Maistra.

=== Before you begin
Install Maistra by following the link:/docs/installation[installation instructions].

=== Create the Bookinfo project
Maistra takes a multi-tenant approach, meaning that you can have more than one
control plane in your OpenShift cluster. Substitute <project> with
the project of your control plane and <bookinfo> with the name of the project to
use for the Bookinfo example.

[source, bash]
----
$ export CONTROL_PLANE_NS=<project>
$ export BOOKINFO_NS=bookinfo
$ oc new-project ${BOOKINFO_NS}
----

{{< notice info >}}
In OpenShift 3, Security Context Constraints (SCC) must be configured for the Bookinfo application. Additional information can be found link:../../installation/application-requirements/[here].
{{< /notice >}}

=== Add Bookinfo project to the Service Mesh
To add the bookinfo project to the control plane SMMR:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc -n ${CONTROL_PLANE_NS} patch --type='json' smmr default -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/members", "value":["'"${BOOKINFO_NS}"'"]}]'
servicemeshmemberroll.maistra.io/default patched
----

The command above adds the Bookinfo project to the control plane's `ServiceMeshMemberRoll (SMMR)` object as an one-line shell command. If you prefer, you can edit it interactively with the help of a text editor by running the command below and adding the Bookinfo project into the `spec.members` list:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc -n ${CONTROL_PLANE_NS} edit smmr default
servicemeshmemberroll.maistra.io/default edited
----

{{< notice tip >}}
At this point Bookinfo project is part of the Service Mesh, meaning that when pods (link:../../installation/automatic-injection/[with the proper annotation], which is the case of our Bookinfo deployment below) are deployed in Bookinfo project they will get the sidecar attached and thus will become part of the mesh.
{{< /notice >}}

=== Deploy Bookinfo Application

. Deploy the Bookinfo application in the bookinfo project:

+

[source, bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc -n ${BOOKINFO_NS} apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/{{< maistraBranch >}}/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
service/details created
deployment.extensions/details-v1 created
service/ratings created
deployment.extensions/ratings-v1 created
service/reviews created
deployment.extensions/reviews-v1 created
deployment.extensions/reviews-v2 created
deployment.extensions/reviews-v3 created
service/productpage created
deployment.extensions/productpage-v1 created
----

. Create the ingress gateway for Bookinfo:

+

[source, bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc -n ${BOOKINFO_NS} apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/{{< maistraBranch >}}/samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
gateway.networking.istio.io/bookinfo-gateway created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/bookinfo created
----

. Set `GATEWAY_URL`:

+

[source, bash]
----
$ export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n ${CONTROL_PLANE_NS} get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----


== Confirm Bookinfo is running

To confirm that Bookinfo has been successfully deployed, execute a curl request and confirm that you get a `200 OK` in response.

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage
200
----

Alternatively, you can open it in your browser:

[source, bash]
----
$ xdg-open http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage
----

=== Add default destination rules
 . If you did *not* enable mutual TLS:

+

[source, bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc -n ${BOOKINFO_NS} apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/{{< maistraBranch >}}/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/productpage created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/reviews created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/ratings created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/details created
----
 . If you *did* enable mutual TLS:

+

[source, bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc -n ${BOOKINFO_NS} apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/{{< maistraBranch >}}/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/productpage configured
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/reviews configured
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/ratings configured
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/details configured
----

[[cleanup]]
=== Cleanup
Delete the bookinfo project to remove the Bookinfo resources.

[source, bash]
----
$ oc delete project ${BOOKINFO_NS}
project.project.openshift.io "bookinfo" deleted
----

Remove the bookinfo project from the control plane's `SMMR` object. Run the following command and remove the bookinfo entry from the `spec.members` list.

[source, bash]
----
$ oc -n ${CONTROL_PLANE_NS} edit smmr default
servicemeshmemberroll.maistra.io/default edited
----
