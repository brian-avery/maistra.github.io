== Bookinfo Application

The following steps describe the deployment of Bookinfo application on Maistra running on Openshift.

=== Before you Begin
Install Maistra by following the instructions link:/docs/getting_started/install[here].


=== Create Bookinfo project
```
  $ oc new-project bookinfo
```

=== Update Security Context Constraints
To add the service account used by Bookinfo application to anyuid and privileged SCCs in "bookinfo" project:

```
  $ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n bookinfo
  $ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n bookinfo
```

=== Deploy Bookinfo Application

. Deploy the Bookinfo application in the bookinfo project:
+
```
  $ oc -n bookinfo apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/bookinfo/maistra-0.12/bookinfo.yaml
```

. Create the ingress gateway for Bookinfo:
+
```
  $ oc -n bookinfo apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/bookinfo/maistra-0.12/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
```

. Set `GATEWAY_URL`:
+
```
  $ export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```


== Confirm Bookinfo is running

To confirm that Bookinfo has been successfully deployed:

```
  $ curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage
```

You should get `200` as a response. Alternatively, you can open it in your browser:
```
xdg-open http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage
```

=== Add default destination rules
 . If you did *not* enable mutual TLS:
+
```
  $ oc -n bookinfo apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml
```
 . If you *did* enable mutual TLS:
+
```
  $ oc -n bookinfo apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml
```
 . To list all available destination rules:
+
```
  $ oc -n bookinfo get destinationrules -o yaml
```

=== Cleanup
Delete the bookinfo project - this will wipe everything we created above:
```
  $ oc delete project bookinfo
```
