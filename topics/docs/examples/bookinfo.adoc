== Bookinfo Application

The following steps describe the deployment of Bookinfo application on Maistra running on Openshift.

=== Before you Begin
Install Maistra by following the instructions link:/docs/installation/install[here].

=== Create the Bookinfo project
Maistra takes a Multi-Tenancy approach, meaning that you can have more than one Istio control plane in your OpenShift cluster. These instructions assume the control plane is installed in the `istio-system` project and this example uses `bookinfo` as the default project. However, either of these can be customized as appropriate below:


```sh
$ export CONTROL_PLANE_NS=istio-system
$ export BOOKINFO_NS=bookinfo
$ oc new-project ${BOOKINFO_NS}
```

{{% notice info %}}
In OpenShift 3, Security Context Constraints (SCC) must be configured for the Bookinfo application. Additional information can be found link:../../getting_started/application-requirements/[here].
{{% /notice %}}

=== Add Bookinfo project to the Service Mesh
To add the bookinfo project to the control plane SMMR:

```sh
$ oc -n ${CONTROL_PLANE_NS} patch --type='json' smmr default -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/members", "value":["'"${BOOKINFO_NS}"'"]}]'
```

The command above adds the Bookinfo project to the control plane's `ServiceMeshMemberRoll (SMMR)` object as an one-line shell command. If you prefer, you can edit it interactively with the help of a text editor by running the command below and adding the Bookinfo project into the `spec.members` list:

```sh
$ oc -n ${CONTROL_PLANE_NS} edit smmr default
```

{{% notice tip %}}
At this point Bookinfo project is part of the Service Mesh, meaning that when pods (link:../../getting_started/automatic-injection/[with the proper annotation], which is the case of our Bookinfo deployment below) are deployed in Bookinfo project they will get the sidecar attached and thus will become part of the mesh.

=== Deploy Bookinfo Application

. Deploy the Bookinfo application in the bookinfo project:
+
```sh
$ oc -n ${BOOKINFO_NS} apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/bookinfo/maistra-1.0/bookinfo.yaml
```

. Create the ingress gateway for Bookinfo:
+
```sh
$ oc -n ${BOOKINFO_NS} apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/bookinfo/maistra-1.0/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
```

. Set `GATEWAY_URL`:
+
```sh
$ export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n ${CONTROL_PLANE_NS} get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```


== Confirm Bookinfo is running

To confirm that Bookinfo has been successfully deployed:

```sh
  $ curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage
```

You should get `200` as a response. Alternatively, you can open it in your browser:
```sh
$ xdg-open http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage
```

=== Add default destination rules
 . If you did *not* enable mutual TLS:
+
```sh
$ oc -n ${BOOKINFO_NS} apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml
```
 . If you *did* enable mutual TLS:
+
```sh
$ oc -n ${BOOKINFO_NS} apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml
```
 . To list all available destination rules:
+
```sh
$ oc -n ${BOOKINFO_NS} get destinationrules -o yaml
```

=== Cleanup
Delete the bookinfo project - this will wipe everything we created above:
```sh
$ oc delete project ${BOOKINFO_NS}
```

Remove the bookinfo project from the control plane's `SMMR` object. Run the following command and remove the bookinfo entry from the `spec.members` list.
```sh
$ oc -n ${CONTROL_PLANE_NS} edit smmr default
```
