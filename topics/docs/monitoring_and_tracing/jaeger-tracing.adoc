== Generate Traces

Once Bookinfo application has been deployed, generate traces by accessing `\http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage` a few times.


== Analyze Tracing Data using Jaeger

The Maistra operator should have created a route to access Jaeger dashboard. Query OpenShift for details of the route:

```
  $ oc get routes jaeger-query -n istio-system
  NAME           HOST/PORT                                    PATH      SERVICES       PORT           TERMINATION   WILDCARD
  jaeger-query   jaeger-query-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io             jaeger-query   jaeger-query   edge          None

```

Point your browser to `\https://jaeger-query-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io`,
select *productpage* from the "Service" drop-down list, and click 
*Find Traces*. You should see a list of available traces similar to one below:

Click on one of the traces in the list to open a detailed view of that trace:

The trace above consists of a few nested spans, each corresponding to a Bookinfo
service call, all performed in response to a `/productpage` request. Overall
processing time was 2.62s, with the "details" service taking 3.56ms, "reviews"
service taking 2.6s, and "ratings" service -- 5.32ms. Each of the calls to the
remote services is represented by a client-side and server-side spans. For
example, "details" client-side span is labeled 
`productpage details.myproject.svc.cluster.local:9080`. The span nested 
underneath it labeled `details details.myproject.svc.cluster.local:9080`
corresponds to the server-side processing of the request.

The trace also shows calls to `istio-policy` which reflect authorization checks made by Maistra.

== Cleanup

Follow the link:/docs/examples/bookinfo/#cleanup[Bookinfo cleanup instructions] to remove the application.
