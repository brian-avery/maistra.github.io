== What is Kiali

_link:http://kiali.io[Kiali]_ is a component which visualises an application's
topology, health, metrics and tracing information to provide a deeper
understanding of the application's behavior and performance. Within a single
view it is easy to determine which services are communicating with each
other, where the traffic is flowing, information about the current health of
the service and other useful metrics.

Kiali also integrates with Jaeger to provide access to distributed tracing
information, allowing you to track an individual request as it flows through
the system and identify potential issues.

=== How does Kiali work?

Every pod deployed as part of the Service Mesh contains a proxy container
responsible for intercepting the application traffic coming into and going
out of the pod. The Service Mesh proxy is automatically created on deployment
of the application and automatically captures information as part of each
service invocation. Kiali uses this information to provide a visualisation of
the Service Mesh behavior. The information includes metrics as well as
distributed tracing information.

=== Generating load

Before looking at the Kiali console, generate some load on
the Service Mesh. From within a new terminal enter the following commands:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
$ export INGRESS_GATEWAY=$(oc get route -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath={.spec.host}')
$ while : ; do curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}/productpage ; sleep 1 ; done
----

=== Opening the Kiali console

To open the Kiali console enter the following command within a new terminal

[source,bash]
----
$ xdg-open https://$(oc get route -n istio-system kiali -o 'jsonpath={.spec.host}')
----

When prompted to login use your OpenShift credentials.

=== Kiali's Graph

Within the Kiali UI select the *Graph* option from the navigation on the left
and then

* `bookinfo` from the `Select a namespace` dropdown
* `Versioned app graph`
* `Requests percentage` from the `No edge labels` dropdown
* `Last 1m`
* `Every 10s`

You should now see the application graph showing traffic being created by our
curl requests above. The traffic will flow from the Service Mesh `ingress
gateway` to the `productpage` service, `reviews` service and finally the
`ratings` service.  There will also be another branch from `productpage` to
`details`. The request percentage will show 100% on every edge
except for the `productpage` edge which splits traffic 50% between
reviews and details and the `reviews` service where the traffic should be split
evenly across all three versions.
