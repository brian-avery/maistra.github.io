== Accessing Grafana UI

A route to access Grafana UI should already exist. Query openshift for details of the route:

```
  $ oc get routes grafana -n istio-system
  NAME      HOST/PORT                               PATH      SERVICES   PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
  grafana   grafana-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io             grafana    http                    None

```

Open http://grafana-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io in a browser, you should see Grafana's home screen, similar to this:

== Istio Mesh Metrics

Select "Istio Mesh Dashboard" from the drop-down list in the top left corner to see Istio mesh metrics:

Generate some traffic by accessing Bookinfo application:

```
$ curl -o /dev/null http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
```

The dashboard should reflect the traffic through the mesh, similarly to this:

== Istio Service Metrics

To see detailed metrics for a service click on a service name in the "Service" column. The service dashboard will look similar to this:

image::grafana-services.png[]

Note that "Tcp Bandwidth" metrics are empty, as Bookinfo uses http-based services only. Lower down on this dashboard are metrics for workloads that call this service (labeled "Client Workloads") and for worloads that process requests from the service (labeled "Service Workloads").

You can switch to a different service or filter metrics by client- and service-worloads by using drop-down lists at the top of the dashboard.


== Istio Workload Metrics

To switch to workloads dashboard, select "Istio Workload Dashboard" from the drop-down list in the top left corner of the screen. You should see a screen similar to this:

image::grafana-workloads.png[]

This dashboard shows workload's metrics, and metrics for client- (inbound) and service (outbound) workloads. You can switch to a different workload, ot filter metrics by inbound or outbound workloads by using drop-down lists at the top of the dashboard.


== Cleanup

Follow link:/docs/examples/bookinfo/#cleanup[Bookinfo cleanup instructions] to remove the application.
